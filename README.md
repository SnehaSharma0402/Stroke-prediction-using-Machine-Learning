Title: Enhancing Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning â€“ A Comparison of Key Algorithms  
Presented at: ISDIA 2025, Dubai  
Date: January 2025  
Status: Accepted and will be published under Springer

## About the Project

The aim of this study was to identify individuals at high risk of cardiac stroke using machine learning models. The dataset used contains patient information like age, glucose level, BMI, smoking habits, etc.

The models used include:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Ensemble methods (Best performance)

## Techniques Used

- Data preprocessing  
- Handling class imbalance using **SMOTE + Random Undersampling**  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Median imputation for missing BMI values  
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC
